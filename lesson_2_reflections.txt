What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When initializing a repository, an empty ".git" folder is created automatically. This folder stores
	all information and snapshots of current folder.
	I need to do it because this command will make an empty repository which is used later to store information of
	current directory. A repository will contain a ".git" folder which is used in version control program called Git.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is like an virtual intermediate part between directory and repository. It helps to prepare what
	files to be added to repository. Moreover, it helps user to confirm themselves that which files are needed to
	update, which files are not. Then staging area will be a place to collect all of needed files to add to 
	repository.
