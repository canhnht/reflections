When would you want to use a remote repository rathen than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to public and share my code to others.
  When I need others to contribute to my project.
  When I want my code and my product to be free to everyone.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to-date with
your remote repository?
	Every pulling will take some time and internet connection. More importantly, it also updates the commit
	history of local repository. So it will make a mess for me to track down what is going on with my local
	repository.
	Manually pulling will give me control over my repository.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks is used on GitHub to clone a repository on GitHub into a new repository ALSO on GitHub but that new repository belongs to my account.
	
	Clones is used on local computer. First use is to make a copy of a repository on GitHub to a new repository in local computer. Second use is to make a copy of a repository on a local computer to a new repository also in
	local computer.

	Branches is used to keep track of different versions of a repository.
