When would you want to use a remote repository rathen than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to public and share my code to others.
  When I need others to contribute to my project.
  When I want my code and my product to be free to everyone.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to-date with
your remote repository?
	Every pulling will take some time and internet connection. More importantly, it also updates the commit
	history of local repository. So it will make a mess for me to track down what is going on with my local
	repository.
	Manually pulling will give me control over my repository.
